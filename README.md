<H1>Description</H1>

<br>

This repository presents a PyBullet-based simulation of a 6-DOF UR5 robotic manipulator designed to detect and track randomly placed and oriented workpieces on a moving conveyor.

<br>

The project focuses on real-time pose estimation and kinematics-based control, utilizing forward and inverse kinematics along with Jacobian-based Resolved Motion Rate Control (RMRC) to synchronize the robot end-effector motion with conveyor dynamics. The simulation incorporates realistic robot behavior, joint limits, and continuous closed-loop control for conveyor tracking tasks.
