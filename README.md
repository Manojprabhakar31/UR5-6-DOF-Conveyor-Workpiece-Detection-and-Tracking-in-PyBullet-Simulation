Description

This repository contains a PyBullet-based simulation of a 6-DOF UR5 robotic manipulator for detecting and tracking randomly placed and oriented workpieces on a moving conveyor. 
The project focuses on real-time pose tracking and kinematics-based control, 
using forward and inverse kinematics along with Jacobian-based resolved motion rate control to synchronize the robot’s end-effector motion with conveyor dynamics.
The simulation models realistic robot behavior, joint limits, and continuous closed-loop control for conveyor tracking tasks.
